            <h2>Biography And Goals</h2>
            <p>Life doesn't always go as palanned, and sometimes, our backup plan can turn into an unexpected opportunity. While engineering wasn't my initial career choice, I have always had a deep appreciation for problem-solving,innovation, and the impact technology has on the world.
            </p>
            <p> Growing up, I was naturally inclined toward math and science, often fasinated by now things worked.Whether it was fixing household items or experimenting with small projects, I found joy in breaking things down and figuring out how to improve them.
                <p>Though my original aspirations lay elsewhere, I realized that engineering could provide a stable and fulfilling career path where i could apply my analytical thinking and creativity.
                <p>By Joining the School of Engineering program, I hope to gain technical expertise, develop problem-solving skills, and explore areas like robotnics, renewable energy, or softwhere development. Even though this may have started as a plan B, I am excited about the possibilites it offers and the potential to make a meaningful impact in the field.</p>
